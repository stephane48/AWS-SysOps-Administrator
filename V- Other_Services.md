### AWS X-Ray
- Debugging in Production, the good old way:
    - Test locally
    - Add log statements everywhere
    - Re-deploy in production
- Log formats differ across applications and log analysis is hard.
- Debugging: one big monolith “easy”, distributed services “hard”
- No common views of your entire architecture

- Enter… AWS X-Ray!
